# Memory Management

Memory management, you're either going to love it or learn to love it.
The phrase itself often strikes fear in the eyes of beginner programmers.
Today, it might *feel* like such a topic is a thing of the past, but we often take for granted how much heavy lifting modern languages do behind the scenes; I'm looking at you, *Python*.
Fortunately for us, Arduino C does a pretty good job at hiding this harsh reality, perfect for beginner programmers.
Unfortunately, as your programs become more complicated, the more necessary it becomes to address this reality.

This isn't necessarily bad, quite the contrary.
Memory management brings you one step closer to understanding how computers work.
I personally feel that an Arduino serves as a great platform to introduce such a topic given how limited system resources are.
It's these limitations that drive creativity and cause you to think outside the box.
If you ask me, I think this is a beautiful side effect.
