# Exercise 2: *Macro Definitions & Build Automation*

In the last exercise, you blinked an LED, and in this lesson, you'll be doing the same thing.
The difference is that in this exercise, I'll cover things to make you a far more effective programmer.

What I'm about to say may be surprising to some of you, but the "best" code is code that is easiest to read and maintain.
*"But wait!"* I hear one of you yelling, *"Isn't the best code the code that runs the fastest!?"*
I too was once under this impression, but soon you realize this isn't the rule, rather the exception.

Programming is an art form.
It is a constant balance between efficiency and elegance.
Is it worth spending hours writing something that will run marginally faster?
I don't know about you, but I value my time over the computer's time.
The only time you *should* be writing the most efficient code is when you've settled on a final design, and you know it will be worth the investment to write marginally more efficient code.
If this is the case, then yes, spend that extra time perfecting your code.

I'll explain more in the breakdown, for now, create sketch `ex2` and type out the following code in the appropriate files.

## The Code

### ex2.ino

```arduino linenums="1"
--8<--
code/arduino-avr-programming/ex2/ex2.ino
--8<--
```

### Makefile

!!! note
	If you are using the Arduino IDE, you can safely ignore this file.

```makefile linenums="1"
--8<--
code/arduino-avr-programming/ex2/Makefile
--8<--
```
