# About the Site

Origins span back to the summer of 2019 when I first discovered GitHub pages, but since then, this project has become far more and is truly a labor of love.
I created this site because I want to spread what I've learned far and wide.

The goal of this site stems from my belief that access to education should be free to anyone in a free society.
As such, I've licensed my work in such a manner that grantees that it stays free for everyone.
